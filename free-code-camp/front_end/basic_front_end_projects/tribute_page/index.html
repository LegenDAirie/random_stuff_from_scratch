              <h2>Accomplishments</h2>

              <ul>
                <li>Now 37, Hassabis was born in London in July 1976 and
                  quickly showed academic promise and skill with board
                  games, especially chess.</li>
                <li>At the ages of 13 Hassabis reached the rank of chess
                  master, and was the second-highest-rated player in
                  the world under 14 at the time – beaten only by the
                  Hungarian chess grandmaster and strongest female chess
                  player in history, Judit Polgár.</li>
                <li>Accelerated through school, Hassabis completed his
                  A-level exams two years early.</li>
                <li>He began a career in video games at British studio
                  Bullfrog Productions, co-designing and lead
                  programming on the classic game Theme Park at 17 years
                  old, alongside the legendary games designer Peter
                  Molyneux.</li>
                <li>Released in 1994, Theme Park sold several million
                  copies and won a Golden Joystick award. The game set
                  players the task of building a successful theme park
                  in the UK with just a few thousand pounds and a small
                  plot of land. (Strategies for success in the game
                  included putting more salt in crisps so people would
                  buy more drinks, making queues long but fast-moving
                  and obscuring the destination, hiring a cleaner to
                  clean the toilets, and placing the exit of one
                  roller-coaster close to the entrance of the next to
                  minimise walking distance between attractions.)</li>
                <li>Hassabis left Bullfrog to study Computer Science
                  Tripos at Cambridge University, which in 1953 had the
                  world's first undergraduate computer science course.
                  He graduated from Queens' College Cambridge with a
                  double first-class honours degree in 1997.</li>
                <li>After graduation, Hassabis rejoined Molyneux, who
                  had now set up another games developer called Lionhead
                  Studios, a breakaway from developer Bullfrog. Hassabis
                  briefly worked as a lead AI programmer on the title
                  Black & White, a game that allowed gamers to play the
                  role of a god ruling over an island populated by
                  various tribes.</li>
                <li>In 1998, Hassabis left Lionhead Studios to found his
                  own London-based independent games developer, Elixir
                  Studios. The company grew to 60 people strong and
                  signed deals with large publishers Vivendi Universal
                  and Microsoft. His games included Republic: The
                  Revolution and Evil Genius. The intellectual property
                  and technology rights from Elixir Studios were sold to
                  various games publishers and the studio was closed in
                  April 2005.</li>
                <li>In 1999, aged 23, he won the Mind Sports Olympiad –
                  an annual international multi-disciplined competition
                  for games of mental skill. He won it a record five
                  times before retiring from competitive play in 2003.
                </li>
                <li>Hassabis was later elected as a fellow of the Royal
                  Society of Arts in 2009 for his influential
                  game-design work and contribution to the games
                  industry.</li>
                <li>Hassabis then changed tack, switching from games
                  development to a career in cognitive neuroscience, to
                  allow him to return to his primary interest in
                  artificial intelligence. During the course of a PhD in
                  cognitive neuroscience at University College London
                  (UCL), Hassabis published several influential papers
                  concerning memory and amnesia.</li>
                <li>His work was listed as in the top 10 scientific
                  breakthroughs of 2007 by Science magazine. Hassabis
                  established a new theory around the way the mind
                  creates and maintains the context of remembered events
                  as a key process underlying both the recall of
                  memories and imagination. Some of Hassabis's findings
                  were subsequently disputed by experts in the field;
                  the debate is still ongoing.</li>
                <li>Hassabis received his PhD in cognitive neuroscience
                  from University College London in 2009. He continued
                  his neuroscience and AI research at the Gatsby
                  Computational Neuroscience Unit at UCL as a Wellcome
                  Trust research fellow. He was also a visiting
                  researcher jointly at MIT and Harvard.</li>
                <li>In 2011 he left academia to co-found a London-based
                  artificial intelligence startup, DeepMind
                  Technologies, with Shane Legg, whom he met at UCL, and
                  Mustafa Suleyman. Among other things, the company
                  developed a computer system capable of understanding
                  and playing an Atari computer game simply by looking
                  at it on a screen as a human would.</li>
                <li>On 27 January, DeepMind was acquired by Google for
                  £400m – the company's largest European acquisition –
                  in order to add technology and talent to Google's core
                  business of search. Google uses AI to understand
                  search queries providing context awareness and
                  allowing users to talk to the computer as they would a
                  human, whether by voice or using a keyboard.</li>
              </ul>
